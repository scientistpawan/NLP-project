Autocorrect is purely based on Natural Language Processing (NLP). As the name suggests that it is programmed in order to correct spellings and errors while typing text.
In this project I have built an autocorrect feature with Python for smartphones. As our smartphone uses past history to match the typed words whether it is correct or not. So here we are required to use some words to run the functionality in our Autocorrect.
So I have used the text from a book to understand it practically.
